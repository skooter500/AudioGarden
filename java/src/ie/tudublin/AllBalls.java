// Description: This is the AllBalls class that extends the Poly class. It creates
// an array of Balls and displays them on the screen. The balls rotate around the center
// of the screen and change colour based on the amplitude of the audio. The balls can also  
// be rotated using the pitch, yaw and roll variables controlled by a midi controller. The
// number of balls can also be changed using a midi controller. The size of the balls can also
// be changed.
